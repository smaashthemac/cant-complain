# Can't Complain

Can't complain is an application with endless pieces of advice to make you feel good; to get you up off the couch; to inspire you to do something that'll make you smile.

On load, the page grabs the user's location and displays a random piece of advice from a database. The user can click again and again until they find one they're interested in, then based on the type of advice, the app will return results from a number of API's â€” for local trails, and weather, for example. It also utilizes Google Maps.

This project was created as an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin.
