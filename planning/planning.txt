* QUESTIONS
- should the user enter their zip code in the very beginning?
	a lot of these use location â€” would be nice to have as a variable up front
	if so, how can i perform a search on my website based on their zip code and return the first few results? is there a google search api?
		* google custom search api - read up on how to do this
- should each thing only have one of a few options? (see step 2 below)
- should i use "fucking"? or "freakin"? or anything at all?
- what should i call it?
- how should the ux for the main page work?
- how should the ux for the submit (post) page work?
- design? colors? layout? fonts?


* ADVICE
1. the thing
2. i want to do that...
	here's how...
		create a mini app with api's
		links to external sites
		make an illustration/image/interactive something "then fucking do it"
3. i don't want to do this thing. find me another thing.
